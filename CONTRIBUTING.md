# Contributing to Beads Web

Welcome! Beads Web is a Next.js 14 TypeScript dashboard for the [Beads](https://github.com/jmcy9999/beads) issue tracker. Whether you are fixing a typo, reporting a bug, or building a new feature, your contributions are appreciated.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the guidelines in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating you agree to uphold a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone.

## Reporting Bugs

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jmcy9999/beads-web/issues) and include:

1. Steps to reproduce the problem
2. Expected behaviour
3. Actual behaviour
4. Environment details (OS, Node.js version, browser)
5. Relevant console output or screenshots

The more detail you provide, the faster we can diagnose and fix the issue.

## Suggesting Features

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jmcy9999/beads-web/issues) with the **enhancement** label. Describe the use case, the proposed behaviour, and any alternatives you considered.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- At least one Beads-initialized repository (run `bd init` inside a repo)

The Beads CLI (`bd`) and beads_viewer (`bv`) are both installed automatically by `npm install`. `bd` is bundled as the `@beads/bd` npm dependency. `bv` is downloaded from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) by the `scripts/install-bv.sh` postinstall script. You do not need to install either tool separately or globally. If the `bv` download fails (no internet, unsupported platform), the app falls back to SQLite-based analytics. The `BV_PATH` environment variable can override the `bv` binary path.

### Steps

1. **Fork and clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/beads-web.git
   cd beads-web
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure the environment** -- create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
   ```
   BEADS_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/your/beads-project
   ```
   This should point to a directory containing one or more repos that have been initialized with `bd init`.
4. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and verify the dashboard loads.

## Code Style

- **TypeScript strict mode** -- avoid `any` types wherever possible.
- **ESLint** with `next/core-web-vitals` -- run `npm run lint` before committing.
- **Tailwind CSS** for all styling -- avoid custom CSS files.
- **Server-side data fetching** via API routes in `src/app/api/`.
- **React Query** (`@tanstack/react-query`) for client-side data management through the hooks in `src/hooks/`.
- **Functional components** and hooks only -- no class components.
- **Named exports** preferred, except where Next.js conventions require default exports.

## Testing

**All new code must be covered by tests. All tests must pass before a PR can be merged.**

Tests are organized into three categories:

| Category | Directory | Environment | What it covers |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Unit tests** | `__tests__/lib/` | Node | Core logic: cache, SQLite reader, JSONL fallback, graph metrics, filter engine |
| **API tests** | `__tests__/api/` | Node | All API route handlers: issues, insights, priority, diff, health, repos |
| **Component tests** | `__tests__/components/` | jsdom | UI components: IssueCard, FilterBar, MetricPanel, ErrorBoundary, ShortcutsHelp |

A test fixture helper at `__tests__/fixtures/create-test-db.ts` creates a temporary `.beads/beads.db` SQLite database with known test data. Use it for any test that needs realistic issue data.

### Running tests

```bash
npm test               # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage  # Run with coverage report
npm test -- --watch    # Watch mode during development
```

### Writing tests

- Place test files alongside their category: `__tests__/lib/`, `__tests__/api/`, or `__tests__/components/`
- Use the test fixture for data: `import { createTestFixture } from "../fixtures/create-test-db"`
- Mock external dependencies (`bv-client`, `repo-config`) in API tests
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Aim for meaningful coverage -- test behavior, not implementation details

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature main
   ```
2. Make your changes.
3. **Write tests for new code** and ensure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```
4. Commit using [Conventional Commits](#commit-message-convention) (see below).
5. Push and open a pull request against `main`.
6. Write a clear PR title and description explaining what changed and why.
7. All CI checks (lint, type check, tests, build) must pass before the PR can be merged.
